# WaveSaver-Robot-Model-Codes
Our solution WaveSaver is a semi-autonomous robot which will engage in immediate Oil Spill incidents to clean and recycle the scattered oil in Ocean and Rivers. WaveSaver doesn’t work only in Tanker Collision spills but also any kind of Oil spill incidents such as, Offshore Drilling and Extraction, Pipelines leakage, Operational Discharges from Ships,  Natural Oil Seeps etc. While tanker collisions are a well-known source of oil spills, a significant amount of oil pollution comes from other sources:
  36% from operational ship discharges.
  70-90% of marine oil pollution from land-based sources
  Natural seeps contributing 600,000 to 2 million tonnes annually.

That’s why our project WaveSaver can work in any kind of Oil Spill disasters. Our robot has 2 units, one is the Autonomous Floating Booms System and the other is the Oil Skimmer or Oil Extractor system. These 2 units can simultaneously work hand to hand. Also this robot can give live reports of the Oil propagation using a drone or any kind of camera above the oil surface. It will also use Water Level Sensor and other relevant sensors to measure the oil level in the water surface and give the necessary datas to users.
